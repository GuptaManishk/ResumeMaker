<p>A resume is the front-line attack in any job hunt. It opens doors, which in 
turn leads to interviews. A well-written resume should put you in a good 
strategic position for an interview. No single thing is “most important” about a 
resume, but it must be impressive to do its job. You can use Resume Maker to 
create impressive, professional resumes. Resume Maker’s Guided Resumes system 
prompts you to enter the appropriate information for your resume. You no longer 
have to figure out what to include on your resume and where to place it...Guided 
Resumes will do the work for you!</p>
<p>Resume Maker also gives you a Guided Resume Window to edit and customize your 
resume. You can change fonts, styles, and add borders. Here’s your chance to add 
your own unique style to your resume. Or, if you prefer, you can set Resume 
Maker to open your favorite word processor.</p>
<p>Hundreds of sample resumes have also been provided to serve as models to 
adapt to your own needs. To take a look at these, open them from the Guided 
Resumes section.</p>
