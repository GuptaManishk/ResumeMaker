<p>Once you have created a resume, it is time to start planning which companies 
should receive a copy. By entering target company contact and networking contact 
information, you can focus your efforts on key companies and keep track of your 
progress. Your contact information is also used when you create Guided Letters.
</p>
<p>Resume Maker helps you keep track of your appointments, deadlines, 
interviews, and other commitments with the calendar. The calendar works 
hand-in-hand with your contact information in the Contact Manager. </p>
<p>Resume Maker also gives you a predetermined selection of the most common To 
Do items, known as the Job Search Checklist, to use in the process of 
maintaining contacts when searching for a new job. </p>
